AI Agent Using Pydantic AI 
                           🤖 AI Agent using Pydantic AI

 📌 Overview
This project is a lightweight, modular AI Agent system built using the `pydantic-ai` library. It demonstrates how to use structured schemas and tool-based logic to interact with language models in a clean and scalable way.

 🚀 Features
      ✅ Schema-driven prompt and response handling
      🔧 Tool and agent orchestration via `pydantic-ai`
      🔄 Asynchronous execution with `nest_asyncio`
      🧠 Integrated with GROQ API for LLM interaction
      🧩 Easily extensible for custom tools and use cases
      💡 Ideal base for building AI copilots and assistants

 🧠 Key Concepts
       **Agent**: A smart controller that manages tools, prompts, and LLM interactions.
       **Tool**: A functional module triggered by user input or context.
       **Schema**: Defines the input/output structure for consistent interactions.
